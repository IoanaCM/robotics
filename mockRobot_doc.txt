# Mock robot designed to simulate all aspects of code except the physical
# turning of motors. This allows testing code without needing the robot
# with you, and no longer requires the brickpi3 module installed.
#
# The signatures of all functions are identical to that of the true robot
# class. As a result to simulate code without the robot, simply change 
# the following 2 lines of code:
#
# import robot        ===>   import mockRobot
# r = robot.robot()   ===>   r = mockRobot.robot()
#
# Since mockRobot no longer drives motors, many functions now do nothing,
# but they are still included and callable, specifically so no additional
# code changes are required.
#
# The mockRobot class must be kept up to date with the real robot class
# any changes to robot should be reflected in mockRobot as the exact same
# code but with any lines referencing self.BP removed
#
# This may be automated by running the Makefile with make mockRobot (or just make)
