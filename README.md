# COMP60016 - Robotics

Coursework completed as 33% of the 3rd Year Robotics Module at Imperial College London

## Task 1 - Accurate Robot Motion (ASSESSED - 30/30)
### 1.1 - Show us a Built and Working Pi/BrickPi Robot with Working WiFi and Motors (6 Marks)

This was demonstrated as part of 1.3

### 1.2 - Investigating And Understanding Motor Control (4 Marks)

DISCUSS PID/DPS HERE

### 1.3 - Distance and Rotation Calibration for Accurate Driving (10 Marks)

DEMONSTRATED

### 1.4 - Experiment to Measure Robot Accuracy (8 Marks)

Carried out 10 loops of a square motion with a pencil attached, marking an X at the final position of the robot. We then measured the (x, y) coordinates of the final position relative to the origin. Our results had some systematic error. as they were 

### 1.5 - Calculating a Covariance Matrix (2 Marks)

INSERT CALCULATIONS HERE + MEANING

## Task 2 - Sensors and Feedback Control

This task was largely attaching and working with new components, including Touch Sensors and the Sonar Sensor. We then completed a Wall Following
